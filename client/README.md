-- footer/mission text (Pathagriha Foundation" is a non-political voluntary literary organization. It is the fortune of this life to be born as a human being. It is also a great honor to be able to work for the society. Dear Pathgriho is trying to open the doors of creative free thinking in a society based on creativity and intellectuality, from that idea. I believe that apart from reading books, the place of thinking is strengthened through knowledge and experience from various sections of society. Teaching books in this society is a difficult task, but our dream is to go far.)
